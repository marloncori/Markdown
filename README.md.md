## What Markdown is
<!-- H3 -->
### A Short Overview

Markdown is a simplified markup language used for formatting text. It gives you a way to write so that it 
can be compiled to HTML.

Markdown has been around since 2004, the year it was created by John Gruber.

## Why and where to use it

Markdown is way easier to write, read and understand than standard HTML. It is evolved immensely, in different ways, over the last seventeen years.

Now it is one the most popular ways to format texts for blog posts, documentation. It is supported even note-taking apps and Python notebooks.

Nowadays you can create even tables and flowcharts with it. Whole research papers and books have been completely written in Markdown.

There is one small downsize, though. There are several different flavours of Markdown out there. So sometimes when you use it different places, you may notice a few minor syntax differences. Why is that so?

The original specification apparently left some questions to be answered. So people basically came up with ways to fill in the gaps on their own.

So, when we have a look at GitHub, a platform that supports it and uses it in README.md files, in another word, 'markdown files', they call it 'GithHub flavored Markdown'. This means they have added some additional features to the original version.

## Additional Information

When you go to forums and certain website, you can notice some of them support Markdown, for example, Discord forums, FreeCodeCamp forum and many other development forums.

If you make use of Python notebooks (for example Jupyter Notebook), you can insert Markdown in any of the cells to format text, put headers and anything else you may need. Those notebooks are pretty standard in a lot of colleges and coding programs now.

It is worthwile highlighting that Python community has its own version of Markdown, which is called RST. Apart from Markdown, there are of course other text formatting markup languages, like AsciiDoc and LaTeX, among others.
